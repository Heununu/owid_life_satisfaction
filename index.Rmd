“Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?”

## 🔢 Table

```{r}
Happiness_change<-happiness %>% 
  rename(Happy = "Happiness: Happy (aggregate)")%>%
  filter(Year %in% c(1993, 2022)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Year, values_from = Happy, id_cols = Country) %>% 
  select(Country, `1993`, `2022`) %>% 
  mutate(`Absolute change` = round(`2022` - `1993`, 3)) %>% 
  mutate(`Relative change` = (`2022` - `1993`) / `1993`) %>% 
  reactable(
    columns = list(`Relative change` = colDef(format = colFormat(percent = TRUE, digits = 1))) 
  )
```

## 🌎 Map

```{r}
happiness_map<-happiness %>%
  rename(Happy = "Happiness: Happy (aggregate)")%>%
  
  mutate(`Happy score` = round(`Happy`, 2)) %>%
  plot_geo(width = 940) %>% 
  add_trace(
    z = ~`Happy score`,
    color = ~`Happy score`,
    locations = ~Code,
    text = ~Country,
    frame = ~Year, colors = "YlGn"
  ) %>% 
  colorbar(title = NULL)
```


## 📈 Chart

```{r}
# simple line chart of the data, for five countries on different continents (ggplot, piped into ggplotly)

happiness_chart <- 
 happiness %>% 
  rename(Happy = "Happiness: Happy (aggregate)")%>%
  filter(Country %in% c("Norway", "Australia", "Germany", "Bolivia", "Colombia", "Bhutan")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = `Happy`, color = Country)) +
  geom_line() +
 # scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 10)) +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = NULL, 
       color = NULL) +
  theme_minimal() 

ggplotly(happiness_chart, width = 940)
```

## Advanced (Optional) 📈

The following chart demonstrates that it is possible to approximate the functionality of our World in Data grapher for multicountry selection using R, specifically with the `crosstalk` package and a small amount of custom JavaScript. For more information on how to achieve this, see [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67058016/how-to-set-default-values-in-filter-select-in-crosstalk-in-r-plotly).

Note that this is not a required task, but rather a showcase of what can be achieved. The code for this will be shared when we provide the solutions for the exercise.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(crosstalk)


# Crosstalk shared data
shared_happiness <- highlight_key(happiness)

happiness_plotly <- plot_ly(
  shared_happiness, 
  x = ~Year, 
  y = ~`Happiness: Happy (aggregate)`, 
  color = ~Country, 
  type = "scatter", 
  mode = "lines+markers"
) %>%
  layout(yaxis = list(range = c(30, 100)))


country_filter <- filter_select(
  "country_filter", 
  "Select a country to examine", 
  shared_happiness, 
  ~Country, 
  multiple = TRUE
)

bscols(
  list(country_filter, happiness_plotly)
)
```

<script>
function filter_default() {
  var default_countries = ["Norway", "Australia", "Germany", "Bolivia", "Colombia", "Bhutan"]; // Set default countries here
  document.getElementById("country_filter").getElementsByClassName("selectized")[0].selectize.setValue(default_countries, false);
}
window.onload = filter_default;
</script>
